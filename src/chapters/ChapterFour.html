        The requirements for a system are the descriptions of what the system should do—
        the services that it provides and the constraints on its operation. These requirements
        reflect the needs of customers for a system that serves a certain purpose such as
        controlling a device, placing an order, or finding information. The process of finding,
        analyzing, documenting and checking these services and constraints is called
        requirements engineering (RE).

        If a company wishes to let a contract for a large software development project,
        it must define its needs in a sufficiently abstract way that a solution is not predefined.
        The requirements must be written so that several contractors can bid for the contract,
        offering different ways of meeting the client organization’s needs. Once a contract has
        been awarded, the contractor must write a system definition for the client in more detail
        so that the client understands and can validate what the software will do.

        Definitions. In practice, for large, complex systems, it is practically impossible to achieve requirements consistency and completeness. One reason is that it is easy to make mistakes and omissions when writing specifications for complex systems. Another reason is that there are many stakeholders in a large system. A stakeholder is a person or role that is affected by the system in some way. Stakeholders have different—and often inconsistent—needs. These inconsistencies may not be obvious when the requirements are first specified, so inconsistent requirements are included in the specification. The problems may only emerge after deeper analysis or after the system has been delivered to the customer.

        Non-functional requirements, as the name suggests, are requirements that are not directly concerned with the specific services delivered by the system to its users. They may relate to emergent system properties such as reliability, response time, and store occupancy. Alternatively, they may define constraints on the system implementation such as the capabilities of I/O devices or the data representations used in interfaces with other systems.
      </p>
      <p class="ch4-card-text mt-2">
        Although it is often possible to identify which system components implement specific functional requirements (e.g., formatting components for reporting), it is often more difficult to relate components to non-functional requirements. The implementation of these requirements may be diffused throughout the system. There are two reasons for this:

    <article class="ch4-card">
      <p class="ch4-card-text">
        1. Non-functional requirements may affect the overall architecture of a system rather than the individual components. For example, to ensure that performance requirements are met, you may have to organize the system to minimize communications between components.
      </p>
      <p class="ch4-card-text mt-2">
        2. A single non-functional requirement, such as a security requirement, may generate a number of related functional requirements that define new system services that are required. In addition, it may also generate requirements that restrict existing requirements.

        The level of detail that you should include in a requirements document depends on the type of system being developed and the development process used. Critical systems need detailed requirements because safety and security must be analyzed in detail. For outsourced development, specifications must be precise. For in-house iterative development, the document can be less detailed, resolving ambiguities during development.

        Figure 4.7 shows one possible organization for a requirements document based on an IEEE standard (IEEE, 1998). This standard is generic and can be adapted to specific uses. It can include predicted system evolution to help maintainers and allow designers to support future system features.

        Naturally, the information included depends on the type of software being developed and the development approach. If an evolutionary approach is adopted, the requirements document may change over time as the system evolves.

    The Structure of a Requirements Document

        Requirements document will leave out many of the detailed chapters suggested above. The focus will be on defining the user requirements and high-level, non-functional system requirements. Designers and programmers use their judgment to decide how to meet the outline user requirements for the system. In large system projects, interacting hardware and software systems often require more detailed requirements.

        Problems with using natural language for requirements specification include ambiguity, misinterpretation by designers with different backgrounds, amalgamation of multiple requirements in a single sentence, and difficulty structuring natural language requirements.

        Requirements specification is the process of writing down user and system requirements in a requirements document. User requirements should be clear, unambiguous, complete, and understandable to non-technical users. System requirements expand on these to guide engineers and may form part of the contract.

        System requirements describe external system behavior and operational constraints without focusing on design. However, for complex software, it is impossible to exclude design information entirely. Reasons include the need for an initial architecture to structure the requirements specification.

    Ways of Writing a System Requirements Specification

        The system requirements specify the different sub-systems that make up the system. This architectural definition is essential if you want to reuse software components when implementing the system (Chapters 6 and 18).

    <!-- Card 2 -->
    <article class="ch4-card">
      <p class="ch4-card-text">
        In most cases, systems must interoperate with existing systems, which constrain the design and impose requirements on the new system.

        Using a specific architecture to satisfy non-functional requirements (e.g., N-version programming for reliability) may be necessary. An external regulator who needs to certify system safety may specify that an already certified architectural design be used.

      <p class="ch4-card-text">
        User requirements are almost always written in natural language, supplemented by diagrams and tables. System requirements may also use forms, graphical models, or mathematical specifications depending on the situation.

        Graphical models are useful to show state changes or sequences of actions (UML sequence charts, state charts). Formal mathematical specifications are occasionally used for safety- or security-critical systems but are rarely used in other cases (Chapter 12).
